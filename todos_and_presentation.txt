* Have a demo in the beginning to show off the capabilities.
* Extend to a Node AND React app <-- expose a frontend to the API.
* Dockerize the app eventually.
* Extend these concepts to explanation videos.
* Explain the inspiration from https://github.com/dvf/blockchain/blob/master/blockchain.py, and then I implemented it in JS

TODO:
* replace log tests with a Jest test suite and runner for each class
* Dockerize a multi-node container in order to start up multiple nodes
* TODO: find 2 other tutorials. Go through them. Then make an implementation that takes the best of all 3.
* transactions and rewards on mining



* TODO place app and p2p-chain-server in app/
* rename app to main.js
* place blockchain and block into a blockchain/ dir
* place transaction-related files like transaction and wallet into a transaction/ dir
* Test the transaction, wallet, and transactionPool?
* Test the app, and p2p-chain-server? If not, nbd.
