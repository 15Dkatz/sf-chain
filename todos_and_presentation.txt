* Have a demo in the beginning to show off the capabilities.
* Extend to a Node AND React app <-- expose a frontend to the API.
* Dockerize the app eventually.
* Harder Proof of Work algorithms?
* Extend these concepts to explanation videos.
* Explain the inspiration from https://github.com/dvf/blockchain/blob/master/blockchain.py, and then I implemented it in JS
* More inspiration from https://lhartikk.github.io/jekyll/update/2017/07/14/chapter1.html
* Sha cryptography from https://github.com/brix/crypto-js

* Add a transaction validation mechanism (cryptocurrency)
TODO: This still doesn't have a transaction validation mechanism
Can read about bitcoin and develop one though - this doesn't have to be accurate
since it's my own implementation. It won't match how Bitcoin does it. I can safely
bet that it will be super simplified. But it gets the idea across.

#### P2P connection and chain-sync proof:
one tab: `HTTP_PORT=3001 P2P_PORT=5001 npm run dev`
x2-3: `http://localhost:3001/mine`
another tab: `HTTP_PORT=3002 P2P_PORT=5002 PEERS=ws://localhost:5001 npm run dev`
Notice the syncage.
Visit: `localhost:3002/blocks`
Visit: `localhost:3000`/blocks`
Then add mine a new block: `http://localhost:3001/mine`
Notice the syncage.

* Give a history of bitcoin, and talk about how long it will take to mine the 100 coins
* Make this upbeat - and YouTubeAble (with highlights/callouts and music)
* Have it scroll over the bitcoin.pdf


TODO:
* replace log tests with a Jest test suite and runner for each class
* Dockerize a multi-node container in order to start up multiple nodes
* TODO: find 2 other tutorials. Go through them. Then make an implementation that takes the best of all 3.
* transactions and rewards on mining
* do we have to test the p2p-chain-server, and the main app? Yes. but how?
* how to *publicly* announce transactions?


* TODO place app and p2p-chain-server in app/
* rename app to main.js
* place blockchain and block into a blockchain/ dir
* place transaction-related files like transaction and wallet into a transaction/ dir

* TODO: make pendingTransactions "official" by storing them in blocks
* TODO: mining reward
