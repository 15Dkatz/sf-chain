* Have a demo in the beginning to show off the capabilities.
* Extend to a Node AND React app <-- expose a frontend to the API.
* Dockerize the app eventually.
* Harder Proof of Work algorithms?
* Extend these concepts to explanation videos.
* Explain the inspiration from https://github.com/dvf/blockchain/blob/master/blockchain.py, and then I implemented it in JS

* Add a transaction validation mechanism (cryptocurrency)
TODO: This still doesn't have a transaction validation mechanism
Can read about bitcoin and develop one though - this doesn't have to be accurate
since it's my own implementation. It won't match how Bitcoin does it. I can safely
bet that it will be super simplified. But it gets the idea across.
